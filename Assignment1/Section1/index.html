        <p>
            Dear Eileen,
            <br>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part</br>
            of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <strong>Starting Dates</strong>
        </h2>

        <p>
            We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
            <br>could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</br>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>First Semester: 2016-09-09</li>
            <li>Second Semester: 2017-01-15</li>
            <li>Third Semester: 2017-05-02</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Subjects of Study
        </h2>

        <p>
            At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall
            <br>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just</br>
            the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued
            <br>by are as follows, in order of priority:
        </p>

        <ol> 
            <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol &#91 C14H12O3. &#93</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30*C &#91 86*F &#93, when the
            <br>audience size exponentially increases &#91 effect of 3x10^3 increasing to 3x10^4. &#93</br></li>
            <li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
            <br>research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</br>
        </p>

            Exotic Dance Moves
        </h2>

        <p>
            Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <en>did</en> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,
            <br>my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</br>
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>
                Polynesian Chicken Dance
            </dt>

            <dd>
                A little known but <en>very</en> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around
                <br>in a little circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</br>
            </dd>

            <dt>
                Icelandic Brownian Shuffle
            </dt>

            <dd>
                Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of gettign warm, they used to practice this dance, which
                <br>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly</br>
                tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
            </dd>

            <dt>
                Arctic Robot Dance
            </dt>

            <dd>
                An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
                <br>discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants</br>
                of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this
                <br>because they were really cold.</br>
            </dd>
        </dl>
